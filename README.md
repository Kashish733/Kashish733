# 👋 Hi, I'm Kashish Bhandari!

🎓 Sophomore studying Computer Science | First-Gen International Student  
🔭 Aspiring Software Engineer and Machine Learning + Sustainability Enthusiast

I'm passionate about using technology to solve meaningful real-world problems — from building systems that support students to analyzing data for insights. As a first-gen international student from Nepal, I believe in resourceful learning, continuous growth, and taking initiative to build the future I want to see. (Ask me about growing my skills and leadership through the Break Through Tech AI Program at Cornell Tech!)

Currently, I’m deepening my skills in machine learning, full-stack development, and building tools that empower underrepresented students in tech. I’m actively seeking an internship where I can contribute to exciting projects and grow under the guidance of experienced professionals — got a lead? Let’s talk!
